# video-folder-to-mp3

Download FFmpeg(https://www.ffmpeg.org/). Give path to executable FFmpeg, give path to your folder and where you want to save it. It will create a batch file and then execute it which will convert all the videos present in current folder to mp3. So it only works for windows as of now.
